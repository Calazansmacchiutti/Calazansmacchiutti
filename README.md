## ðŸ–– About me
<div>
  <p> I have a Physics Bachelor's degree from Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ). As a curious person since childhood, I've immersed myself in the academic world. Currently, I am a Physics Master's degree holder from Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas FÃ­sicas (CBPF) and am in the final year of my PhD at CBPF, with an exchange program at the University of Warwick.</p>
  <p>Throughout this journey, my curiosity and analytical mindset have led me to explore various realms of science and technology. My work primarily involves the experimental synthesis and characterization of new materials, such as perovskite oxides, demanding meticulous attention from creation to final analysis of structural and magnetic properties.</p>
  <p>In addition to my core research, I have developed a keen interest in data science, particularly in the application of machine learning techniques to enhance data analysis and predictive modeling. My engagement with machine learning includes using advanced techniques such as <b>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</b>, <b>Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)</b>, and <b>Random Forest algorithms</b> within the frameworks of <b>TensorFlow</b> and <b>Keras</b>. These tools are particularly effective in analyzing and predicting time series data, which is crucial in understanding dynamic processes in physics.</p>
  <p>RNNs and LSTMs, facilitated by TensorFlow and Keras, are powerful in modeling sequential data, providing the ability to capture time-dependent patterns which are essential for predicting future behavior based on past data. This capability makes them well-suited for applications in physics where time series data are abundant. On the other hand, Random Forest, a robust ensemble learning method, has been invaluable in classification and regression tasks, helping me decipher complex relationships within large sets of experimental data.</p>
  <p>The integration of these machine learning tools with traditional data analysis techniques has significantly enhanced my research capabilities. By leveraging Python and its rich ecosystem of libraries like <b>Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-Learn, Statistics, Matplotlib, and Plotly</b>, I have been able to perform sophisticated data processing, modeling, and visualization to support my experimental findings.</p>
  <p>On this page, you'll also find my published works in the field of physics, featured in well-renowned journals. Feel free to explore these publications "right here".</p>
