## ðŸ–– About me
<div>
  <p>Introducting myself, i have a Physics Bachelor's degree from Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) and a Master's degree from Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas FÃ­sicas (CBPF). I recently completed my PhD at CBPF, which included an exchange program at the University of Warwick. My academic journey has been driven by a deep curiosity and a keen analytical mindset, leading me to explore various scientific and technological fields.</p>
  <p>My primary focus is on the discovery of new materials, specifically through the experimental synthesis and analysis of perovskite oxides, using the interpretation of electrical, magnetic, and other types of signals. This work contributes new materials to the scientific literature, enhancing our understanding and application of these compounds.</p>
  <p>In addition to my core research, I have cultivated a strong interest in data science and machine learning. I specialize in advanced techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Random Forest algorithms, utilizing frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. These tools are particularly effective in analyzing time series data, essential for predicting future behaviors based on past data and understanding dynamic physical processes.</p>
  <p>During my tenure at a startup, I leveraged my skills to model electrical signals from machinery such as compressors, dryers, and induction ovens, employing technologies such as Scikit Learn, Gradient Boosting, Isolation Forest, and Random Forest. My work not only provided real-time performance indicators but also delivered predictive maintenance insights and identified anomalous behavior in machinery operations.</p>
  <p>Leveraging Python and its rich ecosystem, including libraries like <b>Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Plotly</b>, I have significantly enhanced my research and professional capabilities, enabling sophisticated data processing and visualization to support both experimental and business outcomes.</p>
  <p>On this page, you'll also find my published works in the field of physics, featured in well-renowned journals. Feel free to explore these publications "right here".</p>
